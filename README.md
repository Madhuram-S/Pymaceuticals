## Overview - Analysis on drug-based, anti-cancer study 
In this study 250  mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare. 

### Analysis process
The below 4 metrics were analysed to determine the efficacy of the drugs:-
- Rate of change of tumor volume over 45 days
- % change of tumor volume in 45 days
- Rate of increase / decrease of metastatic sites over the treatment
- Survival rate of mice over the treatment of 45 days

In order to account for variability within the sample, Standard Error of Mean(SEM) was also determined and plotted

Scatter plots are created to produce graphical output and to see the trends of efficacy

### Observations
- Most Effiencient : Campomulin outperform the other three drugs in comparison and is the most efficient in terms tumor reduction (reduced by 19%) and better survival rates (84%). It does not stop the spread the tumor but controls to an extent
- Least Efficient : Ketapril is the least efficient with poor survival rate, high % of change in tumor volume and increased growth of metastatic sites
- The other two drugs, Infubinol and Placebo, are not effective either with % of growth in tumor volume 46% and 51% respectively. Infubinol has worst survival rate(36%) and Placebo has a higher rate of metatstaic spread
